* Neutrino2 Ethernet *

This driver implements Ethernet driver for Neutrino2 ethernet controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "qcom,ntn2_avb"
  - ntn-rc-num: PCIe root complex number on which Neutrino is connected

Optional properties:
  - ntn-supply-enable-gpio: GPIO used to control power supply to Neutrino
  - qcom,ntn-disable-phy: Use for devices that don't have a PHY chip
  - qcom,ntn-mac-port-speed: MAC port speed 10Mbps/100Mbps/1000Mbps applicable
                            when qcom,ntn-disable-phy is enabled

Example:
	qcom,ntn2_avb {
		compatible = "qcom,ntn2_avb";
		ntn-supply-enable-gpio = <&pmd9635_gpios 3 0>;
		qcom,ntn-rc-num = <0>;
	};
